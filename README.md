### How to use:
- Clone the project using `git clone https://github.com/bharatnaik2003/chat-server.git`
- `cd chat-server`
- start the server using `python server.py`
- Then after starting the server in another computer or in another terminal(split terminal) run client.py by using `python client.py`
- It will ask for the ip address and port number enter as it says.
- Now you have your own TCP chat server which can be used to communicate between multiple computer
- You can user `ngrok` if you want to communicate between large distances
- If you want to save messages which has been sent by your fellow developer then you can connect it to a database or simply a json file as it doesn't requires too much work.
